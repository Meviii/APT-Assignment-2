Running the tests:
========================
Run ./scrabble < ./Tests/TestGameEngineIO/<testname>.input > ./Tests/TestGameBoardIO/<testname>.output to make the output file.
diff -w ./Tests/TestGameEngineIO/<testname>.output ./Tests/TestGameBoardIO/<testname>.expout to run the IO test.

The test Cases:
========================
passTest tests the result of placing tiles and then passing, passing multiple times, and trying to 'place done' after passing.
placeDoneTest tests entering the command 'place done' after placing tiles, without placing tiles, after passing.
placeTest tests the 7-letter word BINGO, placing tiles not in the current player's hand, placing at occupied board spaces and invalid inputs.
saveTest tests the save game functionality by loading in a save, and saving it to a different save file. The two save files should be identical.
