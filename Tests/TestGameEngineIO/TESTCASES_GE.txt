Running the tests:
========================
Run ./scrabble < ./Tests/TestGameEngineIO/<testname>.input > ./Tests/TestGameBoardIO/<testname>.output to make the output file.
diff -w ./Tests/TestGameEngineIO/<testname>.output ./Tests/TestGameBoardIO/<testname>.gameout to run the IO test.

The test Cases:
========================
pass.input tests the result of placing tiles and then passing, passing multiple times, and trying to 'place done' after passing.
placeDone.input tests entering the command 'place done' after placing tiles, without placing tiles, after passing, lower vs. uppercase
placeTile.input tests the 7-letter word BINGO, placing tiles not in the current player's hand, placing at occupied board spaces and invalid inputs.
replaceTile.input tests replacing a letter in a player's hand, a letter not in a player's hand, attempting to replace an invalid input (num, special character)
save.input tests the save game functionality by loading in a save, and saving it to a different save file. The two save files should be identical.
